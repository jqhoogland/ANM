# ANM
Exercises for a course in my Masters: Advanced numerical methods (ANM)

*From the [course catalogue](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2020-2021-en/search-course/course/79636)*

## Objectives
- Explain, implement, and apply computational methods to study many-body systems, ranging from Monte Carlo simulations in classical statistical physics to tensor network algorithms for quantum many-body systems
- Explain the challenges and the physics of (selected) many-body systems
- Interpret and analyze numerical simulation results

## Contents
The goal of this course is to become familiar with modern computational methods for the simulation of many-body systems in condensed matter physics, including systems from classical statistical physics and quantum many-body problems. Besides the theoretical understanding of these algorithms an important part of the course is to gain practical experience in computational physics by implementing algorithms (programming) and performing simulations.

Topics covered in this course include: Monte Carlo methods, cluster algorithms, Wang-Landau algorithm, classical spin systems (the Ising model and generalizations), critical phenomena, finite size scaling, variational methods, quantum many-body problems and effective lattice models, exact diagonalization, Quantum Monte Carlo and the negative sign problem, Hartree-Fock, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and tensor network methods. For more details see https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.r.corboz/teaching.htm

This course is recommended for students who
- would like to dive into the fascinating field of computational physics
- would like to learn about state-of-the-art methods relevant in many areas in science (also in non-academic areas)
- intend to do a computationally oriented project in future (e.g. Master- or PhD thesis)
- would like to strengthen their understanding in many-body physics
- enjoy programming and would like to get more practice in programming

## Recommended prior knowledge
Basic programming skills and knowledge in statistical physics and basic quantum many-body physics (including second quantization) are required. The course 'Statistical Physics and Condensed Matter Theory I' from the first semester is recommended.
