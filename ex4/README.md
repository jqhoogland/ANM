## Advanced Numerical  Methods in Many-Body Physics
# Exercise 4
### Jesse Hoogland

Most of the actual computational logic is in the file `metropolis_hastings.py` included in this folder.

The actual exercises are worked out in the `Hoogland-Exercise-4.ipynb` notebook included in this folder. That includes the pen-and-paper exercise 4.3 which has been typed out in latex at the end of the jupyter notebook.
